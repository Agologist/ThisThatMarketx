# Testing Coin Delivery Modal

## Issue Explanation
The user in the screenshot has already voted on the poll (as shown by "Your vote" indicator and "You have already voted" button), so the new coin delivery modal cannot trigger. The modal only appears for NEW votes to prevent duplicate voting.

## How to Test the New Modal Flow
1. Create a new poll and vote on it, OR
2. Use a different user account to vote on an existing poll

## Expected Flow for New Votes
1. User selects an option and clicks vote
2. Coin delivery modal appears asking for wallet preference
3. User can either:
   - Enter Solana wallet address for coin delivery
   - Skip for demo mode (coin generated but not delivered)
4. Vote completes with chosen delivery method

## Current Status
- Modal implementation is complete and integrated
- Voting flow modified to show modal before completing vote
- All existing functionality preserved
- Ready to test with fresh vote
